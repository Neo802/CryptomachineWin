# CryptomachineWin - Windows port of the original Cryptomachine
This project was initially released on GitHub on January 19th 2025, for Android, now ported to Windows on July 15th 2025 in C++ thanks to the Qt Framework.
It is capable of performing several cryptographic tasks for several classical **cypher algorithms**, such as:
- Caesar 
- Vatsayana
- Vigenere
- Beaufort
- Autokey
- Playfair
- Two-Square
- Four-Square
